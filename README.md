# Box-office-analysis
Data analysis and visualization of the box office datasets from The Movie Database 
This project-based on Analyzing Box Office Data with Plotl,Python,Seaborn and The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set.
The motion picture industry is raking in more revenue than ever with its expansive growth the world over. so i build models to accurately predict movie revenue.The results from these models be used to further increase revenue, by using exploratory data analysis (EDA)  and feature engineering.
Here I primarily use Plotly for data visualization. Plotly Python which is Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs ready for both online and offline use.Also i use Seaborn wwhich is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
